# ENPM 661 Project 3 Phase 2 : TurtleBot A star Planner
#### Project Members : Adil Qureshi, Khuzema Habib, Sounderya Venugopal

##  Project Description

In this project, we use an A star Path Planner to generate a trajectory for a given map in 3 different environments:

- 2D Environment
- Gazebo
- Falcon Simulator

We first run the 2D Path Planner to generate a trajectory for the other 2 simulations in 3D, applying clearances where required. The 2D Map was generated with the use of half planes and semi-algebraic equations in Matplotlib then visualized in opencv for trajectory generation.
